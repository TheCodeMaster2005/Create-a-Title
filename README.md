# Create a Title

Building AI course project

## Summary

This software will go through a story to figure out what it is about and come up with a catchy title for the story without you having to go through the effort of thinking of something yourself. It can use currently existing stories as a wide range of training data to understand how titles are made and what relation they have to the story.

## Background

So many times when I'm writing a story, I can't think of a title that'll do it justice. Or maybe I'll come with half a dozen potential titles and be torn over which one to choose. Although a software such as this might not give me an amazing final title I can use, it will, at the very least, push me in the right direction, or give me a hint as to what the title can be related to. 

With so many stories out there, it won't be difficult to train the system with many different genres and types of stories and titles. And, if this becomes a reality, next time you're deeply confused over what to name your story, this software will be waiting, either to nudge you in the right direction or hand you the very answer you were looking for.

## How is it used?

This can be used if you're writing a story and struggling to come up with a title, whether you want to publish a book or simply hand in a school assignment. The user can input their story, or perhaps a few paragraphs outlining what the story is about, and wait for the magic to happen. If they don't like the result, they can try again until the system outputs a title that they do like. Or, they can use the system's suggestion and modify it slightly according to their own wishes. The uses are limitless!

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

## Data sources and AI methods

Training data can be found almost anywhere - there are thousands if not millions of stories out there, on websites such as Archive of Our Own, FanFiction, Wattpad, etc. Novels can be used to train the system too. Moreover, the system can learn from the test data - once a title is decided for a story that a user asked for, it can be added to the training data to be used for future reference.

## Challenges

Something that might be more difficult to train the system with are titles which don't have anything directly to do with the story. For example, in the novel Turtles All The Way Down by John Green, the title, though mentioned in the story, doesn't directly form a part of the story - there are no literal turtles in the story going down. Another example of this is A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini - there aren't a thousand suns in the sky. The system must be trained to understand that even offshoots such as these can make great titles.

## What next?

The next step now is the major one - actually creating the system.
